Lesson 4:
Remix FundMe
We're going to create a crowdfunding type program called FundMe where users can pay in cryptocurrency to fund a cause.
This contract will allow the owner of the contract to withdraw the funds.
A new item we'll see in this lesson is a payable function (indicated by a red button in remix)
this allows the contract in question to be sent the native gas token of the chain you're working with is.
We'll also indicate a minimum USD amount in the contract.
